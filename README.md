## Customer Analysis Dashboard - Tableau Practice Project

## 📊 Project Overview

This repository showcases a **Tableau** practice project focused on **Customer Analysis**. The project involves creating interactive and insightful dashboards to visualize and analyze customer demographics, behavior, and sales performance. The goal is to transform raw customer data into actionable business intelligence to help drive strategic decisions related to marketing, sales, and customer service.

## 🎯 Objectives

- To analyze **customer demographics** (age, gender, location, etc.).
- To understand **customer purchasing behavior** and spending patterns.
- To identify **key customer segments** for targeted marketing campaigns.
- To calculate and visualize **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** such as Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), acquisition cost, and retention rates.
- To create an interactive **Tableau Story** or **Dashboard** for a comprehensive view of customer insights.

## 📁 Project Contents

This repository contains:
- **Tableau Workbook File** (`.twbx` or `.twb`): The main Tableau file containing all worksheets, dashboards, and the story.
- **Data Source** (if applicable): A sample dataset (e.g., CSV, Excel) used for the analysis.
- **Documentation**: This README and any additional notes on the analysis.

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed

### 1. Customer Demographics
- **Geographic Distribution**: A map visualization showing where customers are located.
- **Age and Gender Breakdown**: Pie/bar charts displaying the composition of the customer base.
- **Income Distribution**: Analysis of customer income brackets.

### 2. Sales & Behavioral Analysis
- **Sales by Customer Segment**: Which segments (e.g., new vs. returning, high-value) generate the most revenue?
- **Purchase Frequency**: How often do customers make a purchase?
- **Average Order Value (AOV)**: What is the average spend per order across different segments?

### 3. Customer Performance KPIs
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: The total predicted revenue from a customer over their relationship with the business.
- **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**: How much it costs to acquire a new customer.
- **Retention & Churn Rate**: The percentage of customers who return over a specific period.

### 4. Trend Analysis
- **Sales Trends Over Time**: Monthly/quarterly sales performance.
- **Seasonal Buying Patterns**: Identifying peaks and troughs in customer purchasing.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Tableau Desktop/Public**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Data Source**: Likely a structured dataset (e.g., CSV, Excel, SQL Database extract).
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**: Possibly used Tableau Prep, Excel, or SQL for initial data wrangling.

## 📈 Dashboard Features

The Tableau dashboard(s) likely include:

- **Interactive Filters**: Allow users to filter by date, region, product category, etc.
- **KPIs with Conditional Formatting**: Key metrics that update dynamically.
- **Tooltips**: Detailed information available on hover for deeper insights.
- **Drill-Down Capabilities**: Ability to click on a chart to see more detailed data.
- **Mobile-Responsive Design** (if applicable): Ensuring the dashboard is viewable on different devices.

## 📋 Key Insights (Example)

Based on the analysis, some potential insights could include:
- **Top-Spending Region**: The majority of high-value customers are located in [Region X].
- **Most Profitable Segment**: Customers aged 25-34 generate over 40% of total revenue.
- **Seasonal Trend**: Sales peak in Q4, suggesting a need for targeted holiday campaigns.
- **Retention Challenge**: The churn rate is highest among customers acquired through [Channel Y], indicating a need to improve the post-purchase experience.

## 📝 Notes on Methodology

- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and standardized data formats before analysis.
- **Calculated Fields**: Created custom fields in Tableau (e.g., Customer Segment bins, Profit Ratio, CLV).
- **Blending**: Possibly combined data from multiple sources.
- **Focus on Storytelling**: Designed the dashboard to guide the viewer through a logical narrative of the data.
